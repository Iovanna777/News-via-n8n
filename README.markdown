Welcome to my content factory! This n8n workflow grabs trending news, turns them into slick videos with AI avatars and subtitles, and posts them to TikTok and YouTube after a quick human nod in Telegram. Built and tested by me, it‚Äôs a real-world project that saves time and makes content creation as easy as scrolling your feed. üòé

## üìñ What Does It Do?

This workflow automates the entire pipeline of creating and publishing video content based on trending news. Here‚Äôs the flow:

1. **Fetches News**: Pulls hot posts from Hacker News (e.g., "AI Breakthrough in Robotics").
2. **Generates Text**: Uses OpenAI (ChatGPT) to craft catchy titles, short descriptions (TikTok-friendly), and detailed descriptions (YouTube-ready).
3. **Creates Videos**: Sends text to Heygen for videos with a digital avatar that‚Äôs cooler than most influencers.
4. **Adds Subtitles**: Pipes the video to Vizard for stylish, auto-generated subtitles.
5. **Moderates Content**: Sends a preview to a Telegram bot for a quick "Yay or Nay" check.
6. **Publishes**: Uploads approved videos to TikTok (short and snappy) and YouTube (longer and informative).
7. **Logs Everything**: Saves all data (news, texts, video links) to Google Sheets for tracking.

**Result**: 5‚Äì7 videos per week with minimal effort, ready to go viral while you sip coffee. ‚òï

### Example Output
- **News**: "AI Breakthrough in Robotics"
- **Title**: "Robots Are Thinking Now! ü§ñ #AI"
- **Short Description**: "New AI tech makes robots smarter than ever!"
- **Logged in Google Sheets**: News URL, title, description, video link, timestamp.

## üõ†Ô∏è Connected Services

This workflow is like a digital orchestra, with n8n as the conductor. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs plugged in:

- **Hacker News API**: Grabs trending tech news (filtered for 100+ upvotes).
- **OpenAI API (ChatGPT)**: Generates titles (e.g., max 60 chars for TikTok), short descriptions (150 chars), and long descriptions (500 words).
- **Heygen API**: Creates videos with customizable AI avatars (voice, style, background). Outputs MP4 in 1080p, 16:9 (YouTube) or 9:16 (TikTok).
- **Vizard API**: Adds auto-generated subtitles with customizable fonts/colors. Multi-language support optional.
- **Telegram Bot API**: Sends previews (video + text) with buttons like "Publish" or "Tweak".
- **YouTube API**: Uploads videos with titles, descriptions, and tags.
- **TikTok API**: Posts short videos with hashtags for max reach.
- **Google Sheets API**: Logs data for monitoring and debugging.
- **n8n**: The glue that orchestrates everything, handling retries and scheduling.

## üéØ Why Does It Exist?

Manually creating video content is like solving a puzzle with missing pieces‚Äîslow, pricey, and frustrating. This workflow:
- **Saves Time**: Cuts 10‚Äì15 hours of weekly work to ~10 minutes of moderation.
- **Scales Content**: Pumps out daily videos without a team of editors.
- **Keeps It Fresh**: Turns news into content in 1‚Äì2 hours.
- **Boosts Engagement**: Optimized for TikTok (viral) and YouTube (informative).
- **Saves Money**: Replaces editors ($1,000‚Äì$2,000/month) and SMM teams ($1,000‚Äì$2,000/month) with a one-time setup.

Perfect for startups, content creators, or HR agencies looking to automate video content (e.g., job ads or company culture videos).
